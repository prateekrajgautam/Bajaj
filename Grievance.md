# Grievance 

- I am writing to formally raise a grievance regarding a fraudulent transaction related to a Bajaj loan, which was misrepresented to me as an Overdraft (OD) account. The account details are attached for your reference.


- At the time of opening the account, I was explicitly informed that I would not be required to pay any amount other than what I withdraw. However, once the account was opened, I discovered that several charges, including processing fees and stamp duty, amounting to ₹23,111, had been imposed. This was never disclosed to me beforehand.


- Upon confronting the Bajaj Finserv representative Yash Gole and his sales associate Chetan Choudhary, they agreed to refund the processing fee. The refund proof is attached as Document 2. This refund was only processed after I warned them of filing a complaint with the RBI.



## Further Misrepresentation and Unethical Practices

- As my OD account approaches 10 months, I am continuously receiving calls from Bajaj Finserv representatives pressuring me to accept additional charges. They have informed me that an AMC charge has been applied in their app and that it can be waived only if I purchase some insurance or other services or restructure/refinance. When I pointed out that this AMC charge was never disclosed at the time of account creation, they dismissed my concerns, stating:
"Sir, I am a program lead at Bajaj Finserv, and I know how Bajaj Finance operates. Filing complaints will not change anything."

- This statement is unacceptable and reflects a serious lack of transparency I request full forclosure of my account without any charges (as I have not approached them for Overdraft, I only accepted their offer as they said there are no charges on it).

## I have few call recordings and WhatsApp chats as evidence, which substantiate my claims. Below are the details:

1.    [Call Recording 001: Sales representatives assured me that all charges would be waived if I did not withdraw any amount.

# Request for Resolution

1. Immediate foreclosure of the OD account with a waiver on foreclosure charges as they never inform about AMC.
2. A written/email confirmation that no further charges will be applied to my account.
